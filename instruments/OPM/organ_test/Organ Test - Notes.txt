--- 80'S ORGAN: YM2612 AND YM2151 DIFFERENCES ---
80's Organ was originally intended for YM2612, as this particular chip's specification causes a buzz for the high operator levels.
The YM2151 will simply make it play pure sine-waves.

--- SPECIAL THANKS ---
Organ 3 Alt (Rock Organ Alt) - thanks to freq-mod for providing the parameters to make that sound!
Church Organ - mainly based off of the high score theme from Swords of Fury.
All the rest are chosen by me.
