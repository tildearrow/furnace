# submit instruments

you may submit your own instruments by creating a pull request or contacting me! the only guidelines are:

- any format Furnace is able to load is accepted.
- I (strongly) prefer original instruments.
- your instruments have to be free of restrictions (these may be used in any project).
  - be careful if your instrument contains samples.
- please be careful to put new instruments in the right folders.
