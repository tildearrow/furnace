# unstable build notice

this is a dev build (also known as "unstable", "artifact" or "nightly").
it may contain work-in-progress features and/or bug fixes.

no compatibility is guaranteed between unstable and stable - you have been warned!

# the .pdb file

YOU SHALL COPY THIS FILE ALONGSIDE furnace.exe. it contains debug information which is vital in the moment of a crash.
failure to copy this file will result in useless backtraces (furnace_crash.txt) and therefore hinder me from fixing any crashes.
