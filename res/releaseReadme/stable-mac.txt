# Furnace (chiptune tracker)

thank you for downloading Furnace! I hope you enjoy using it.

move Furnace to Applications (or some other place).
if you are using a recent version of macOS, you may get an error saying that Furnace is damaged.
in that case, open Terminal, and type this:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Furnace.app
```

(replace `/path/to/Furnace.app` with the path where Furnace.app is located, e.g. `/Applications/Furnace.app`)

you may need to reboot after doing this before launching Furnace.
