# Furnace (chiptune tracker)

thank you for acquiring Furnace! I hope you enjoy using it.

# help

if you are using a recent version of macOS, you may get an error saying that Furnace is damaged.
in that case, open Terminal, and type this:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Furnace.app
```

(replace `/path/to/Furnace.app` with the path where Furnace.app is located, e.g. `/Applications/Furnace.app`)

you may need to reboot after doing this before launching Furnace.


some technical computing background is recommended for the best experience.
be sure to read the `manual.pdf` file for information on how to use this program.

if you find issues (e.g. bugs or annoyances), report them. links below.
