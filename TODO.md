# to-do

- add cheat code to insert bruno time (blank)

# THE REAL TO-DO LIST

- Song is silent after playing an order after loop point
- Select loaded instrument on open - rewrite because I want a setting...
- finish auto-clone

once you have done all of this (maybe not the first one) and merged the two or so pending pull requests, release 0.6.1

Furnace is like alcohol...

# and then

- new oscilloscope renderer - custom code that uses texture and fixes two issues: too many vertices, and broken anti-aliasing
- new pattern renderer - performance improvements
