# to-do for 0.6pre1

- rewrite the system name detection function anyway
- add another FM editor layout
- add ability to move selection by dragging
- find and replace
- implement Defle slide bug when using E1xy/E2xy and repeating origin note (requires format change)

# to-do for 0.6pre2 (as this requires new data structures)

- Game Boy envelope macro/sequence
- volume commands should work on Game Boy
- add the fucking SNES (but that's obvious)
