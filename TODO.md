# to-do for 0.6pre7

- tutorial?
- ease-of-use improvements... ideas:
  - preset compat flags
  - maybe reduced set of presets for the sake of simplicity
  - a more preferable highlight/drag system
  - some speed/intuitive workflow improvements that go a long way 
  - make .pdf manual out of doc/
  - break compatibility if it relieves complexity
- multi-key binds
- bug fixes
