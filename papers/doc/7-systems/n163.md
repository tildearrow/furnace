# Namco 163 (also called N163, Namco C163, Namco 106 (sic), Namco 160 or Namco 129)

This is one of Namco's NES mappers, with up to 8 wavetable channels. It has also 256 nibbles (128 bytes) of internal RAM, and both channel registers and wavetables are stored here. Wavetables are variable in size and freely allocable anywhere in RAM, it means it can use part of or continuously pre-loaded waveform and its sequences in RAM. At least 64 bytes can dedicated to waves, with more available if not all channels are used - waveform RAM area becomes smaller as more channels are activated, since channel registers consume 8 bytes for each channel. You must avoid conflict with channel register area and waveform to avoid broken channel playback.

Namco 163 does not internally mix its channels. Instead, each channel is output one at a time, when multiple channels are used it will cycle between them; so its sound quality gets more crunchy as more channels are activated.

Furnace supports loading waveforms into RAM and waveform playback simultaneously, and channel limit is dynamically changeable with effect commands.
You must load waveform to RAM first for playback, as its load behavior auto-updates when every waveform changes.
Both waveform playback and load command  works independently per each channel columns, (Global) commands  don't care about the channel columns for work commands and its load behavior is independent with per-channel column load commands.

# effects

- `10xx`: set waveform for playback.
- `11xx`: set waveform position in RAM for playback. (single nibble unit)
- `12xx`: set waveform length in RAM for playback. (04 to FC, 4 nibble unit)
- `130x`: set playback waveform update behavior. (0: off, bit 0: update now, bit 1: update when every waveform is changed)
- `14xx`: set waveform for load to RAM.
- `15xx`: set waveform position for load to RAM. (single nibble unit)
- `16xx`: set waveform length for load to RAM. (04 to FC, 4 nibble unit)
- `170x`: set waveform load behavior. (0: off, bit 0: load now, bit 1: load when every waveform is changed)
- `180x`: set channel limit (0 to 7, x + 1)
- `20xx`: (Global) set waveform for load to RAM.
- `21xx`: (Global) set waveform position for load to RAM. (single nibble unit)
- `22xx`: (Global) set waveform length for load to RAM. (04 to FC, 4 nibble unit)
- `230x`: (Global) set waveform load behavior. (0: off, bit 0: load now, bit 1: load when every waveform is changed)
