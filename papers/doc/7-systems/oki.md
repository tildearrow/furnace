# OKI MSM6258 | OKI MSM6295

MSM6258 is a single-channel ADPCM sound source developed by OKI. It allows max sample rate of 15.6 kHz... with no variable pitch. Most prominent use of this chip was Sharp X68000 computer, where it was paired with Yamaha YM2151.

MSM6295 is an upgrade from 6258 - it provides 4 ADPCM channels, at max 32 kHz (still no variable pitch though). Between late 80s and late 90s, it was one of the most common, if not THE most common soundchip used in arcade machines (Capcom, Toaplan, Kaneko, Atari, Tecmo, the list can go on and on...)
