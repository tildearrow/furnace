# Namco WSG | Namco C15 | Namco C30

a family of wavetable synth sound chips used by Namco in their arcade machines (Pacman and later). Waveforms are 4-bit, with 32-byte sample length.

Everything starts with Namco WSG, simple 3ch wavetable with no extra frills. C15 is much more advanced sound source with 8 channels. C30 adds stereo output and noise mode.
