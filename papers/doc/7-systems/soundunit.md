# tildearrow Sound Unit
This is a fantasy sound chip, used in the specs2 fantasy computer designed by tildearrow. It includes native support for sample playback, but with only 8KB or 64KB of sample data, depending on the configuration used. Since 0.6pre1, this sound chip is no longer hidden by default and can be accessed through the module creation screen and can be added or removed.

# effects

- `10xx`: set waveform
  - 0: pulse wave
  - 1: sawtooth
  - 2: sine wave
  - 3: triangle wave
  - 4: noise
  - 5: periodic noise
  - 6: XOR sine
  - 7: XOR triangle
- `12xx`: set pulse width (0 to 7F)
- `13xx`: set resonance of filter (0 to FF)
  - despite what the internal effects list says (0 to F), you can use a resonance value from 0 to FF (255)
- `14xx`: set filter mode and ringmod
  - bit 0: ring mod
  - bit 1: low pass
  - bit 2: high pass
  - bit 3: band pass
- `15xx`: set frequency sweep period low byte
- `16xx`: set frequency sweep period high byte
- `17xx`: set volume sweep period low byte
- `18xx`: set volume sweep period high byte
- `19xx`: set cutoff sweep period low byte
- `1Axx`: set cutoff sweep period high byte
- `1Bxx`: set frequency sweep boundary
- `1Cxx`: set volume sweep boundary
- `1Dxx`: set cutoff sweep boundary
- `1Exx`: set phase reset period low byte
- `1Fxx`: set phase reset period high byte
- `20xx`: toggle frequency sweep
  - bit 0-6: speed
  - bit 7: up direction
- `21xx`: toggle volume sweep
  - bit 0-4: speed
  - bit 5: up direction
  - bit 6: loop
  - bit 7: alternate
- `22xx`: toggle cutoff sweep
  - bit 0-6: speed
  - bit 7: up direction
