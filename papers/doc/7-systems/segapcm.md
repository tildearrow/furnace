# SegaPCM

16 channels of PCM? no way!

yep, that's right! 16 channels of PCM!

a chip used in the Sega OutRun/X/Y arcade boards. eventually the MultiPCM surpassed it with 24 channels, and later they joined the software mixing gang.

  - `xx` is a 256th fraction of 31250Hz.
  - this effect exists for mostly DefleMask compatibility - it is otherwise recommended to use Sample type instruments.
