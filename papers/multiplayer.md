# multiplayer protocol

this is a concept! it has not been implemented yet!

the Furnace protocol is described here.

# information

all numbers are little-endian.

the following fields may be found in "size":
- `f` indicates a floating point number.
- `STR` is a UTF-8 zero-terminated string.
- `CFG` is the same as STR, but contains a config.
- `???` is an array of variable size.
- `S??` is an array of `STR`s.
- `1??` is an array of bytes.
- `2??` is an array of shorts.
- `4??` is an array of ints.

two player IDs are reserved:
- 0: system
- 1: host (console)

two usernames are reserved:
- SYSTEM
- HOST

some characters are not allowed in usernames: 0x00-0x1f, `@`, 0x7f-0x9f, 0xd800-0xdfff, 0xfeff, 0xfffe and 0xffff.

the sequence number always starts at 0.

# client to server packets (init)

## 0x00: keep-alive

this packet keeps a connection alive.
the server shall respond with a packet of type 0x00 (keep-alive).
if the client does not receive any packets during 30 seconds, it will disconnect from the server.
likewise, if the server does not receive any packets during 30 seconds, it will disconnect the client.

## 0x01: start connection

after sending, you will receive a packet of type 0x01 (information), 0x02 (disconnect) or 0x03 (authenticate).

## 0x02: disconnect

# server to client packets (init)

## 0x00: keep-alive

this packet keeps a connection alive. it is a response to a client's keep-alive packet.

## 0x01: information
```
size | description
-----|------------------------------------
  4  | server version
  2  | online players
     | - if it is 65535, this information is concealed.
  2  | maximum players
     | - 0 means unlimited.
 STR | server version (string)
 STR | server name
 STR | server description
 STR | project name
```
the client may send a 0x00 (keep-alive) packet after receiving this one within 5 seconds.
connection is then closed.

## 0x02: disconnect
```
size | description
-----|------------------------------------
 STR | reason
```
after being sent, the connection is closed.

## 0x03: authenticate
```

## 0x16: project submission information
```

this is followed by several 0x17 (project data) packets representing a Furnace song. see [format.md](format.md) for more information.

## 0x17: project submission data
```
size | description
-----|------------------------------------
  4  | offset
  4  | length
 ??? | data...
```
the client will send a packet with project size as offset and 0 as length to indicate end of data.
the server subsequently loads the project.

-----|------------------------------------
