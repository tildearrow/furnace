# the Furnace file format (.fur)

while Furnace works directly with the .dmf format, I had to create a new format to handle future additions to the program.

this document has the goal of detailing the format.

**notice:** GitHub's Markdown formatter may break on this file as it doesn't seem to treat tables correctly.

# information

files may be zlib-compressed, but Furnace accepts uncompressed files as well.

all numbers are little-endian.

the following fields may be found in "size":
- `f` indicates a floating point number.
- `STR` is a UTF-8 zero-terminated string.
- `???` is an array of variable size.
- `S??` is an array of `STR`s.
- `1??` is an array of bytes.
- `2??` is an array of shorts.
- `4??` is an array of ints.

the format has changed several times across versions. a `(>=VER)` indicates this field is only present starting from format version `VER`, and `(<VER)` indicates this field is present only before version `VER`.

furthermore, an `or reserved` indicates this field is always present, but is reserved when the version condition is not met.

the `size of this block` fields represent the size of a block excluding the ID and the aforementioned field.
these fields are 0 in format versions prior to 100 (0.6pre1).

# patchbay

Furnace dev135 adds a "patchbay" which allows for arbitrary connection of chip outputs to system outputs.
it also allows connecting outputs to effects and so on.

a connection is represented as an unsigned int in the following format:

- bit 16-31: source port
- bit 0-15: destination port

a port is in the following format (hexadecimal): `xxxy`

- `xxx` (bit 4 to 15) represents a portset.
- `y` (bit 0 to 3) is the port in that portset.

reserved input portsets:
- `000`: system outputs
- `FFF`: "null" portset

reserved output portsets:
- `000` through `01F`: chip outputs
- `FFD`: wave/sample preview
- `FFE`: metronome
- `FFF`: "null" portset

# subsong

from version 95 onwards, Furnace supports storing multiple songs on a single file.
the way it's currently done is really weird, but it provides for some backwards compatibility (previous versions will only load the first subsong which is already defined in the `INFO` block).

# old instrument (<127)

instruments in older versions of Furnace used a different format. see [oldIns.md](oldIns.md) for more information.

## C64 compatibility note (>=187)

in Furnace dev187 the volume and cutoff macros have been separated, as noted above.
however, there are two other changes as well: **inverted relative (non-absolute) cutoff macro**; and a new, improved Special macro.

if version is less than 187, you must convert the Special macro:
1. do not continue if ex4 is not a Sequence type macro!
2. move bit 0 of ex4 macro data into bit 3.
3. set bit 0 on all steps of ex4 macro to 1.
4. if ex3 is not a Sequence type macro, stop here.
5. if ex3 macro length is 0, stop here.
6. merge the ex3 macro (former Special) into ex4 (former Test).
  - use the largest size (between ex3 and ex4).
  - if the ex3 macro is shorter than the ex4 one, use the last value of ex3, and vice-versa.
  - if the ex4 macro length is 0, expand it to the largest size, and set all steps to 1.

don't worry about loop or release...

     | - read a byte per row.
     | - if it is 0xff, end of data. the rest of the pattern is empty.
     | - if bit 7 is set, then skip N+2 rows. N is bits 0-6.
     |   - for example, $80 means skip 2 rows, $81 means skip 3, $82 means 4 and so on.
     | - if bit 7 is clear, then:
     |   - bit 0: note present
     |   - bit 1: ins present
     |   - bit 2: volume present
     |   - bit 3: effect 0 present
     |   - bit 4: effect value 0 present
     |   - bit 5: other effects (0-3) present
     |   - bit 6: other effects (4-7) present
     |   - if none of these bits are set, then skip 1 row.
     | - if bit 5 is set, read another byte:
     |   - bit 0: effect 0 present
     |   - bit 1: effect value 0 present
     |   - bit 2: effect 1 present
     |   - bit 3: effect value 1 present
     |   - bit 4: effect 2 present
     |   - bit 5: effect value 2 present
     |   - bit 6: effect 3 present
     |   - bit 7: effect value 3 present
     | - if bit 6 is set, read another byte:
     |   - bit 0: effect 4 present
     |   - bit 1: effect value 4 present
     |   - bit 2: effect 5 present
     |   - bit 3: effect value 5 present
     |   - bit 4: effect 6 present
     |   - bit 5: effect value 6 present
     |   - bit 6: effect 7 present
     |   - bit 7: effect value 7 present
     | - then read note, ins, volume, effects and effect values depending on what is present.
     | - for note:
     |   - 0 is C-(-5)
     |   - 179 is B-9
     |   - 180 is note off
     |   - 181 is note release
     |   - 182 is macro release

     |   - volume
     |   - effect and effect data (Ã effect columns)
     | - for note/octave, if both values are 0 then it means empty.
     | - for instrument, volume, effect and effect data, a value of -1 means empty.
