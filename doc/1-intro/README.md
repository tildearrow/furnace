# introduction

Furnace is a tool which allows you to create music using sound chips ("chiptune"), most from the 8/16-bit era.

it has a large selection of features and sound chips. from the NES, SNES and Genesis to ES5506, VIC-20 or even Arcade, Furnace has most likely covered your target with many presets to choose from.

every chip is emulated using many emulation cores, therefore the sound that Furnace produces is authentic to that of real hardware.

## hexadecimal

Furnace uses hexadecimal (abbreviated as "hex") numbers frequently. see [this guide](hex.md) for a crash course.

## interface

Furnace uses a music tracker interface. think of a table with music notes written on it. then that table scrolls up and plays the notes. even experienced tracker musicians might benefit from a quick review of [tracker concepts and terms](concepts.md) before using Furnace. there's also a [glossary of common terms](glossary.md).

due to its nature of being feature-packed, it may be technical and somewhat difficult to get around. therefore we added a basic mode, which hides several advanced features.

it also has a flexible windowing system which you may move around and organize.

see [2-interface](../2-interface/README.md) and [3-pattern](../3-pattern/README.md) for more information.

once familiar with the tracker, look to [9-guides](../9-guides/README.md) for useful techniques.
