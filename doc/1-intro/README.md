# introduction

Furnace is a tool which allows you to create music using sound chips ("chiptune"), most from the 8/16-bit era.

it has a large selection of features and sound chips. from the NES, SNES and Genesis to ES5506, VIC-20 or even Arcade, Furnace has most likely covered your target with many presets to choose from.

every chip is emulated using many emulation cores, therefore the sound that Furnace produces is authentic to that of real hardware.

## quick start

if you just want to jump right in and get going, we recommended you go through the [quick start guide](quickstart.md) first. it should get you familiar enough with the program to comprehend the rest of the documentation.

## hexadecimal

Furnace uses hexadecimal (abbreviated as "hex") numbers frequently. see [this guide](hex.md) for a crash course.

## interface

Furnace uses a music tracker interface. think of a table with music notes written on it. then that table scrolls up and plays the notes.
for an introduction to a tracker interface, see [tracker concepts and terms](concepts.md) before using Furnace.
there's also a [glossary of common terms](glossary.md).

Furnace uses a flexible windowing system which you may move around and organize. see [2-interface](../2-interface/README.md) and [3-pattern](../3-pattern/README.md) for more information.

once familiar with the tracker, look to [9-guides](../9-guides/README.md) for useful techniques.
