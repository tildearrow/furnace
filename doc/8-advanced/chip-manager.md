The **chip manager** window does exactly what it says.

**Preserve channel order**: Make existing pattern data stay in place even when chips are rearranged. If turned off, pattern data will rearrange to match (the default, and usually the desired behavior).

To move a chip around, click and drag the ![crossed-arrows](chip-manager-move.png) button to its left.

To replace a chip with a different one, click the ![down-angle](chip-manager-change.png) and select the replacement.

To remove a chip entirely, click the ![X](chip-manager-remove.png) button.

Click a chip's name to open its options, where one can set clock rate, chip variant, and other specifics.
