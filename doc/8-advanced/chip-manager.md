# chip manager

The **chip manager** window does exactly what it says.

"Preserve channel order" will make existing pattern data stay in place even when chips are rearranged. If turned off, pattern data will rearrange to match (the default, and usually the desired behavior).

To move a chip around, click and drag the ![crossed-arrows](chip-manager-move.png) button to its left.

To replace a chip with a different one, click the ![down-angle](chip-manager-change.png) and select the replacement.

To remove a chip entirely, click the ![X](chip-manager-remove.png) button.

Click a chip's name to open its options, where one can set clock rate, chip variant, and other specifics.
