**Preserve channel order**: make existing pattern data stay in place even when chips are rearranged. when turned off, pattern data will be arranged to match (the default, and usually desired behavior).

**Clone channel data**: when cloning chips, also copy patterns, pattern names, channel names and other parameters to the clone.

**Clone at end**: instead of inserting the clone directly after the cloned chip, add it to the end.

to move a chip around, click and drag the ![crossed-arrows](chip-manager-move.png) button to the left.

to duplicate a chip, click the **Clone** button.

to replace a chip with a different one, click the **Change** button. this will display the chip selector.

to remove a chip, click the ![X](chip-manager-remove.png) button.

click on a chip's name to open chip configuration. this allows you to change chip options, such as clock rate, chip type and so on.
