# piano / input pad

The piano serves as a non-keyboard interface to input notes.

The buttons at the left do the following:

|  |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| move one octave down | move one octave up | open options |
| fewer visible octaves | more visible octaves | swap buttons |

When swapped, the bottons do the following:

|  |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| input note off | input note release | open options |
| input macro release | delete | swap buttons |

Every C key is labelled with its octave.

Right-clicking on the piano keys will make the buttons disappear; right-clicking again brings them back.
