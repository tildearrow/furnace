# compatibility flags

The **Compatibility Flags** window contains several tabs full of settings that change aspects of tracking and playback. A new Furnace file will leave them all at their defaults (off), while opening a DefleMask, Amiga MOD, or earlier Furnace file will automatically set the appropriate options.

Hovering over most options will bring up additional info about them. It's not recommended to change any of these without clear reason. _There be dragons here._
