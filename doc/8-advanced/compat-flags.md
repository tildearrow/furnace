# compatibility flags

the **Compatibility Flags** window contains several tabs full of settings that change aspects of tracking and playback. a new Furnace song will have these disabled, while opening a DefleMask module, .mod, or earlier Furnace file will automatically set the appropriate options.

hovering over most options will bring up additional info about them. it is not recommended to change any of these, especially the ones in the DefleMask and Old Furnace sections.
