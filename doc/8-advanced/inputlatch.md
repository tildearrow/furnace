- `&&` fills in the currently selected instrument.
- `..` ignores the column.
- all columns (except note) can be reset with a right-click.
- **Set**: sets latch according to the data found at the cursor.
- **Reset**: resets all columns to default (selected instrument, ignore others).
- only the first effect type and effect value may be latched.
