# channels

The "Channels" dialog allows manipulation of the song's channels.

Each channel has the following options:
- "Visible": uncheck the box to hide the channel from view. Pattern data will be kept.
- Crossed-arrows button: Click and drag to rearrange pattern data throughout the song. _Note:_ This does **not** move channels around within a chip! It only affects pattern data.
- "Name" is the name displayed at the top of each channel in the tracker view.
- To the right of that is the abbreviation used above each channel in the order view.
