# channels

the "Channels" dialog allows manipulation of the song's channels.

![channels dialog](channels.png)

each channel has the following options:
- **Pat**: uncheck the box to hide the channel from the pattern view. pattern data will be kept.
- **Osc**: uncheck the box to hide the channel from the per-channel oscilloscope view.
- crossed arrows buttons: click and drag to rearrange pattern data throughout the song.
  - note: this does **not** move channels around! it only moves the channel's pattern data.
- **Name**: the name displayed at the top of each channel in the pattern view.
- the next setting is "short name", which is displayed in the orders view and/or when a channel is collapsed.
