# menu bar

the menu bar allows you to select from five menus: file, edit, settings, window and help.

## file

- **new...**: opens the new song dialog to choose a system.
  - click a system name to create a new song with it.
  - some systems have several variants, which are inside a group.
- **open...**: opens the file picker, allowing you to select a song to open.
  - see [file formats](formats.md) for a list of formats Furnace is able to open.
- **open recent**: contains a list of the songs you've opened before.
  - **clear history**: erases the file history.
- **save**: saves the current song.
  - opens the file picker if this is a new song, or a backup.
- **save as...**: opens the file picker, allowing you to save the song under a different name.
- **export...**: allows you to export your song into other formats, such as audio files, VGM and more. see the [export](export.md) page for more information.
- **manage chips**: opens the [Chip Manager](../8-advanced/chip-manager.md) dialog.
- **restore backup**: restores a previously saved backup.
  - Furnace keeps up to 5 backups of a song.
  - the backup directory is located in:
    - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\furnace\backups`
    - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Furnace/backups`
    - Linux/other: `~/.config/furnace/backups`
  - this directory grows in size as you use Furnace. remember to delete old backups periodically to save space.
  - **do NOT rely on the backup system as auto-save!** you should save a restored backup because Furnace will not save backups of backups.
- **exit**: closes Furnace.

## edit

- **...**: does nothing except prevent accidental clicks on later menu items if the menu is too tall to fit on the program window.
- **undo**: reverts the last action.
- **redo**: repeats what you undid previously.
- **cut**: moves the current selection in the pattern view to clipboard.
- **copy**: copies the current selection in the pattern view to clipboard.
- **paste**: inserts the clipboard's contents in the cursor position.
  - you may be able to paste from OpenMPT as well.
- **paste special...**: variants of the paste feature.
  - **paste mix**: inserts the clipboard's contents in the cursor position, but does not erase the occupied region.
  - **paste mix (background)**: does the same thing as paste mix, but doesn't alter content which is already there.
  - **paste with ins (foreground)**: same thing as paste mix, but changes the instrument.
  - **paste with ins (background)**: same thing as paste mix (background), but changes the instrument.
  - **paste flood**: inserts the clipboard's contents in the cursor position, and repeats until it hits the end of a pattern.
  - **paste overflow**: paste, but it will keep pasting even if it runs over another pattern.
- **delete**: clears the contents in the selection.
- **select all**: changes the selection so it covers a larger area.
  - if the selection is wide, it will select the rows in a column.
  - if the selection is tall, it will select the entire column.
  - if a column is already selected, it will select the entire channel.
  - if a channel is already selected, it will select the entire pattern.
- **operation mask**: toggles which columns will be affected by the listed operations. [more information here.](../8-advanced/opmask.md)
- **input latch**: determines which data are placed along with a note. [more information here.](../8-advanced/inputlatch.md)
- **note/octave up/down**: transposes notes in the current selection.
- **values up/down**: changes values in the current selection by ±1 or ±16.
- **transpose**: transpose notes or change values by a specific amount.
- **interpolate**: fills in gaps in the selection by interpolation between values.
- **change instrument...**: changes the instrument number in a selection.
- **gradient/fade...**: replace the selection with a "gradient" that goes from the beginning of the selection to the end.
  - does not affect the note column.
  - **Nibble mode**: when enabled, the fade will be per-nibble (0 to F) rather than per-value (00 to FF).
    - use for effects like `04xy` (vibrato).
- **scale...**: scales values in the selection by a specific amount.
  - use to change volume in a selection for example.
- **randomize**: replaces the selection with random values.
  - does not affect the note column.
  - **Nibble mode**: when enabled, the randomization will be per-nibble (0 to F) rather than per-value (00 to FF).
- **invert values**: `00` becomes `FF`, `01` becomes `FE`, `02` becomes `FD` and so on.
- **flip selection**: flips the selection so it is backwards.
- **collapse/expand amount**: allows you to specify how much to collapse/expand in the next two menu items.
- **collapse**: shrinks the selected contents.
- **expand**: expands the selected contents.
- **collapse pattern**: same as collapse, but affects the entire pattern.
- **expand pattern**: same as expand, but affects the entire pattern.
- **collapse song**: same as collapse, but affects the entire song.
  - it also changes speeds and pattern length to compensate.
- **expand song**: same as expand, but affects the entire song.
  - it also changes speeds and pattern length to compensate.
- **find/replace**: shows [the Find/Replace window](../8-advanced/find-replace.md).
- **clear...**: opens a window that allows you to mass-delete things like songs, unused instruments, and the like.

## settings

- **full screen**: expands the Furnace window so it covers your screen.
- **lock layout**: prevents you from dragging/resizing docked windows, or docking more.
- **pattern visualizer**: toggles pattern view particle effects when the song plays.
- **reset layout**: resets the workspace to its defaults.
- **user systems...**: shows the User Systems window. this is detailed in [the User Systems documentation](../8-advanced/user-systems.md).
- **settings...**: shows the Settings window. these are detailed in [the Settings documentation](settings.md).

## help

- **effect list**: displays the effect list.
- **debug menu**: this menu contains various debug utilities.
  - unless you are working with the Furnace codebase, it's not useful.
- **inspector**: this option shows the Dear ImGui Metrics/Debugger window.
  - unless you are working with the Furnace codebase, it's not useful.
- **panic**: this resets all chips while the song is playing, effectively silencing everything.
- **about...**: displays the About screen.

at the end of the menu bar, more information may be shown:
- during editing, information about the data under the cursor will be shown here:
  - note or note modifier.
  - instrument number and name.
  - volume in decimal, hex, and percentage.
  - effect type and description.
- during playback, these values will be displayed:
  - `speed/groove @ tick rate (BPM) | order | row | elapsed time`
- if any changes or edits have been made but not yet saved, "modified" will appear.
