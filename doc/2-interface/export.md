# export

Furnace allows you to export your song in several formats. this section deals with describing the available export options.

## export audio

this option allows you to export your song in .wav format. I know I know, no .mp3 or .ogg export yet, but you can use a converter.

there are two parameters:

- **Loops**: sets the number of times the song will loop.
  - does not have effect if the song ends with `FFxx` effect.
- **Fade out (seconds)**: sets the fade out time when the song is over.
  - does not have effect if the song ends with `FFxx` effect.

and three export choices:

- **one file**: exports your song to one .wav file.
- **multiple files (one per chip)**: exports the output of each chip to .wav files.
- **multiple files (one per channel)**: exports the output of each channel to .wav files.
  - useful for usage with a channel visualizer such as corrscope.

## export VGM

this option allows exporting to a VGM (Video Game Music) file. these can be played back with VGMPlay (for example).

the following settings exist:

- **format version**: sets the VGM format version to use.
  - versions under 1.70 do not support per-chip volumes, and therefore will ignore the Mixer completely.
  - other versions may not support all chips.
  - use this option if you need to export for a quirky player or parser.
    - for example, RYMCast is picky with format versions. if you're going to use this player, select 1.60.
- **loop**: includes loop information. if disabled, the resulting file won't loop.
- **loop trail**: sets how much of the song is written after it loops.
  - the reason this exists is to work around a VGM format limitation in where post-loop state isn't recorded at all.
  - this may change the song length as it appears on a player.
  - **auto-detect**: detect how much to write automatically.
  - **add one loop**: add one more loop.
  - **custom**: allows you to specify how many ticks to add.
    - `0` is effectively none, disabling loop trail completely.
  - this option will not appear if the loop modality isn't set to None as there wouldn't be a need to.
- **chips to export**: select which chips are going to be exported.
  - due to VGM format limitations, you can only select up to two of each chip type.
  - some chips will not be available, either because VGM doesn't support these yet, or because you selected an old format version.
- **add pattern change hints**: this option adds a "hint" when a pattern change occurs. only useful if you're a developer.
  - the format of the "hint" data block that gets written is: `67 66 FE ll ll ll ll 01 oo rr pp pp pp ...`
    - `ll`: length, a 32-bit little-endian number
    - `oo`: order
    - `rr`: initial row (a 0Dxx effect is able to select a different row)
    - `pp`: pattern index (one per channel)
- **direct stream mode**: this option allows DualPCM to work. don't use this for other chips.
  - may or may not play well with hardware VGM players.

## export text

this option allows you to export your song as a text file.

## export ZSM

ZSM (ZSound Music) is a format designed for the Commander X16 to allow hardware playback.
it may contain data for either YM2151 or VERA chips.
Calliope is one of the programs that supports playback of ZSM files.

the following settings are available:

- **Tick Rate (Hz)**: select the tick rate the song will run at.
  - I suggest you use the same rate as the song's.
  - apparently ZSM doesn't support changing the rate mid-song.
- **loop**: enables loop. if disabled, the song won't loop.
- **optimize size**: removes unnecessary commands to reduce size.

click on **Begin Export** to... you know.

## export command stream

this option exports a text or binary file which contains a dump of the internal command stream produced when playing the song.

it's not really useful, unless you're a developer and want to use a command stream dump for some reason (e.g. writing a hardware sound driver).

- **export (binary)**: exports in Furnace's own command stream format (FCS). see `export-tech.md` in `papers/` for details.
- **export (text)**: exports the command stream as a text file. only useful for analysis, really.
