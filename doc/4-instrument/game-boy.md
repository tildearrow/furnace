# Game Boy instrument editor

GB instrument editor consists of two tabs: one controlling envelope of sound channels and macro tab containing several macros.

## Game Boy

- **Use software envelope**: switch to volume macro instead of envelope
- **Initialize envelope on every note**: forces a volume reset on each new note
- **Volume**: initial channel volume (range 0-15)
- **Length**: envelope decay/attack duration (range 0-7)
- **Sound Length**: cuts off sound after specified length, overriding the Length value

- **Up and Down radio buttons**: Up makes the envelope an attack, down makes it decay. _Note:_ For envelope attack to have any effect, start at a lower volume!

- **Hardware Sequence**: (document this)

## Macros

- **Volume**: volume sequence. _Note:_ This only appears if "Use software envelope" is checked.
- **Arpeggio**: pitch in half-steps
- **Duty/Noise**: pulse wave duty cycle or noise mode sequence
- **Waveform**: ch3 wavetable sequence
- **Panning**: output for left and right channels
- **Pitch**: fine pitch
- **Phase Reset**: trigger restart of waveform
