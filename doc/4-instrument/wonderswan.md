# WonderSwan instrument editor

## Sample tab
The WonderSwan system is capable of playing samples on its second channel. As such, you can specify a sample to play here.

## Wavetable tab
This tab uses the GUI from the wavetable synth editor. This feature needs its own dedicated page...

## Macros tab
- **Volume**: Standard volume macro.
- **Arpeggio**: Coarse tuning macro, in half steps.
- **Noise**: Whether noise is enabled on this channel or not. (Only useful on the last channel, since it's the only one capable of playing white noise.)
- **Waveform**: What wavetable to play on the current channel.
- **Pitch**: Fine pitch macro.
- **Phase Reset**: Toggling the macro on phase resets the channel, for as many times as it's set to on.
