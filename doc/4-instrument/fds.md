# FDS instrument editor

## FDS tab:
- **Compatibility mode**: enable this only if working with .dmf modules.
- **Modulation depth**: how much to modulate the FDS' output.
- **Modulation speed**: how fast to modulate the FDS' output.
- **Modulation table:**: the waveform that should be used to modulate the FDS' output. think of it like the OPL, where you can have multiple waveforms and those waveforms can modulate each other and/or each operator.

## Wavetable tab:
wavetable synthesizer settings are here. since it's not a hardware feature, and since it can be used on other wavetable systems, it deserves its own document...

## Macros tab:
- **Volume**: the volume sequence.
- **Arpeggio**: a pitch macro, but it deals with semitones instead.
- **Waveform**: what waveform to select.
- **Pitch**: use this to change the fine pitch of the channel.
- **Mod Depth**: described in the FDS tab section
- **Mod Speed**: described in the FDS tab section
- **Mod Position**: The position to be at in the modulation table, described in the FDS tab section.
