# Namco 163 instrument editor

The Namco 163 instrument editor consists of two tabs: "Namco 163" for control of various waveform parameters, and "Macro" containing several macros.

## Namco 163

- **Waveform**: Determines the initial waveform for playing.
- **Offset**: Determines the initial waveform position will be load to RAM.
- **Length**: Determines the initial waveform length will be load to RAM.
- **Load waveform before playback**: Determines the load initial waveform into RAM before playback.
- **Update waveforms into RAM when every waveform changes**: Determines the update every different waveform changes in playback.


## Macros

- **Volume**: volume levels sequence
- **Arpeggio**: pitch sequence
- **Waveform**: sets waveform source for playback immediately or update later
- **Panning**: output for left and right channels
- **Pitch**: fine pitch
- **Phase Reset**: trigger restart of waveform
<!--
- **Waveform pos.**: sets the waveform source address in RAM for playback (single nibble unit)
- **Waveform len.**: sets the waveform source length for playback (4 nibble unit)
- **Waveform update**: sets the waveform update trigger behavior for playback
- **Waveform to load**: sets waveform source for load to RAM immediately or later
- **Wave pos. to load**: sets address of waveform for load to RAM (single nibble unit)
- **Wave len. to load**: sets length of waveform for load to RAM (4 nibble unit)
- **Waveform load**: sets the waveform load trigger behavior
