# Namco 163 instrument editor

the Namco 163 instrument editor consists of three tabs: "Namco 163" for control of various waveform parameters, "Wavetable" for control of the wave synth and "Macro" containing several macros.

## Namco 163

- **Load waveform**: if enabled, a waveform will be loaded when this instrument plays.
  - if it isn't then only the position/length change.
- **Waveform**: determines the waveform that will be loaded.
  - only appears when Load waveform is enabled.
- **Per-channel wave position/length**: when enabled, the position/length settings are split per channel.
- **Position**: determines the waveform position in RAM.
- **Length**: determines the waveform length in RAM.

## Wavetable

this allows you to enable and configure the Furnace wavetable synthesizer. see [this page](wavesynth.md) for more information.

note that setting the Update Rate to something greater than 1 and playing the instrument in two channels may result in conflicts.

## Macros

- **Volume**: volume levels sequence.
- **Arpeggio**: pitch sequence.
- **Wave Pos**: sets waveform seek position in RAM.
- **Waveform**: sets waveform.
- **Pitch**: fine pitch.
- **Wave Length**: sets waveform length.
<!--
- **Phase Reset**: trigger restart of waveform
