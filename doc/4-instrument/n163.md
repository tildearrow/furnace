# Namco 163 instrument editor

The Namco 163 instrument editor consists of two tabs: "Namco 163" for control of various waveform parameters, and "Macro" containing several macros.

## Namco 163

- [Waveform] - Determines the initial waveform for playing.
- [Offset] - Determines the initial waveform position will be load to RAM.
- [Length] - Determines the initial waveform length will be load to RAM.
- [Load waveform before playback] - Determines the load initial waveform into RAM before playback.
- [Update waveforms into RAM when every waveform changes] - Determines the update every different waveform changes in playback.


## Macros

- [Volume] - volume levels sequence
- [Arpeggio]- pitch sequence
- [Waveform] - sets waveform source for playback immediately or update later
- [Panning] - output for left and right channels
- [Pitch] - fine pitch
- [Phase Reset] - trigger restart of waveform
<!--
- [Waveform pos.] - sets the waveform source address in RAM for playback (single nibble unit)
- [Waveform len.] - sets the waveform source length for playback (4 nibble unit)
- [Waveform update] - sets the waveform update trigger behavior for playback
- [Waveform to load] - sets waveform source for load to RAM immediately or later
- [Wave pos. to load] - sets address of waveform for load to RAM (single nibble unit)
- [Wave len. to load] - sets length of waveform for load to RAM (4 nibble unit)
- [Waveform load] - sets the waveform load trigger behavior
