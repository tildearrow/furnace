# X1-010 instrument editor

X1-010 instrument editor contains three tabs: Sample, Wavetable and Macros.

## Sample

for sample settings, see [the Sample instrument editor](sample.md).

the only differences are the lack of an "Use wavetable" option, and the presence of a "Use sample" one.

there also is a "Sample bank slot" setting, but I think that does nothing for now.

## Wavetable

this allows you to enable and configure the Furnace wavetable synthesizer. see [this page](wavesynth.md) for more information.

## Macros

- **Volume**: volume levels sequence.
- **Arpeggio**: pitch sequence.
- **Waveform**: waveform selection sequence.
- **Panning (left)**: output level for left channel.
- **Panning (right)**: output level for right channel.
- **Pitch**: fine pitch.
- **Envelope Mode**: sets up envelope. the way it works is kind of complicated and even I don't understand how it works, so it's not documented for now.
- **Envelope**: specifies which wavetable should be used for envelope.
- **AutoEnv Num**: sets the envelope to the channel's frequency multiplied by numerator.
- **AutoEnv Den**: sets the envelope to the channel's frequency divided by denominator.
  - the X1-010 hardware envelope is considerably slower than AY's. beware!
  - these two must be set in order for AutoEnv to work!
