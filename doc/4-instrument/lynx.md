# Atari Lynx instrument editor

## Sample tab
The Lynx is capable of playing back samples on any channel, as each channel has a "volume only"/DAC mode, that allows for it to play samples.

## Macros tab
- **Volume**: Standard volume macro. If `int` mode is turned on, the volume macro will be used as a filter strength register of sorts.
- **Arpeggio**: Coarse pitch macro, in semitones.
- **Duty/Int**: Timbre macro.
  - The Atari Lynx uses an [LFSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register) to generate its waves. In fact, all the other Atari sound chips do. But the difference is, the Lynx allows you to adjust the bits that are used in the LFSR. You can use or abuse this feature to make some really weird wavetable-like sounds.
  - The `int` mode makes it so that when the Lynx inverts the channel to produce a click, this pop becomes interpolated, in a way. The strength of this interpolation filter is gauged via the volume macro.
- **Panning (left)**: Panning macro for the left channel. Affects volume, but not the `int` mode.
- **Panning (right)**: Ditto, but for the right channel instead.
- **Pitch**: Fine pitch macro.
- **Phase Reset**: Every time this value is set on, it phase resets the channel.

## Audio generation description

The Atari Lynx generates sound using a 12-bit linear feedback shift register with configurable tap. Nine separate bits can be enabled to be the source of feedback: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 11. To generate any sound at least one bit must be enabled.

The LFSR is shifted at the rate define by sound pitch and generates square wave by setting channel output value to +volume or -volume, depending on the bit shifted in.
Triangle wave

Alternatively when the `int` bit is set sound wave is generated by adding or subtracting volume from output effectively producing a triangle wave, depending on what bit is set.

Hint: To obtain a triangle wave set bits `int` and "11" in "Duty/Int" sequence and set volume to about 22. By enabling 11th tap bit, the value shifted in is negated after 11 bit is shifted in, hence the volume is added for 11 cycles and then subtracted for 11 cycles.
