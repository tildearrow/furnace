# Commodore PET instrument editor

the PET instrument editor consists of these macros:

- **Volume**: volume sequence (on/off).
- **Arpeggio**: pitch sequence.
- **Waveform**: an 8Ã—1 waveform, entered as a bitmask representing on-off pulses. this has nothing to do with wavetable assets, which cannot be used with the PET.
- **Pitch**: fine pitch sequence.
