# OPL FM synthesis instrument editor

the OPL FM editor is divided into 7 tabs:

- **FM**: for controlling the basic parameters of FM sound source.
- **Macros (FM)**: for macros controlling algorithm and feedback.
- **Macros (OP1)**: for macros controlling FM parameters of operator 1.
- **Macros (OP2)**: for macros controlling FM parameters of operator 2.
- **Macros (OP3)**: for macros controlling FM parameters of operator 3 (only when 4-op flag is set and only on OPL3!).
- **Macros (OP4)**: for macros controlling FM parameters of operator 4 (only when 4-op flag is set and only on OPL3!).
- **Macros**: for other macros (volume/arp/pitch/pan).

## FM

the OPL synthesizers are nominally two-operator (OPL3 supports 4-operator mode on up to six channels), meaning it takes two oscillators to produce a single sound.

these apply to the instrument as a whole:
- **Algorithm (ALG)**: determines how operators are connected to each other (0-1 range and OPL1 and OPL2; 0-3 range on OPL3 4op mode).
  - left-click pops up a small "operators changes with volume?" dialog where each operator can be toggled to scale with volume level.
  - right-click to switch to a preview display of the waveform generated on a new note:
    - left-click restarts the preview.
    - middle-click pauses and unpauses the preview.
    - right-click returns to algorithm view.
- **Feedback (FB)**: determines how many times operator 1 returns its output to itself (0 to 7).

- **4-op**: enables 4-operator FM instrument editor mode (only on OPL3).
- **Drums**: enables OPL drum mode editor.

these apply to each operator:
- the crossed-arrows button can be dragged to rearrange operators.
- **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**: makes the operator affected by LFO tremolo.
- **Sustain flag (SUS)**: when enabled, the envelope pauses ("sustains") once it reaches the Sustain Level and does not proceed to the release phase until note off.
- **Attack Rate (AR)**: determines the rising time for the sound. the bigger the value, the faster the attack (0 to 15).
- **Decay Rate (DR)**: determines the diminishing time for the sound. the higher the value, the shorter the decay. it's the initial amplitude decay rate (0 to 15).
- **Sustain Level (SL)**: determines the point at which the sound ceases to decay and changes to a sound having a constant level. the sustain level is expressed as a fraction of the maximum level (0 to 15).
- **Release Rate (RR)**: determines the rate at which the sound disappears after note off. the higher the value, the shorter the release (0 to 15).
- **Total Level (TL)**: represents the envelopeâ€™s highest amplitude, with 0 being the largest and 63 (decimal) the smallest. a change of one unit is about 0.75 dB.
- **Key Scale Level (KSL)**: also known as "Level Scale". determines the degree to which the amplitude decreases according to the pitch.

- **Key Scale Rate (KSR)**: also known as "Rate Scale". determines the degree to which the envelope execution speed increases according to the pitch.
- **Frequency Multiplier (MULT)**: sets the coarse pitch offset in relation to the note (0 to 15). The values follow the harmonic scale. For example, 0 is -1 octave, 1 is 0 octaves, 2 is 1 octave, 3 is 1 octave 7 semitones, and so on.
  - note that values 11, 13 and 14 behave as 10, 12 and 12 respectively.
- **Waveform Select (WS)**: changes the waveform of the operator (OPL2 and OPL3 only, 0-3 range on OPL2 and 0-7 on OPL3).
- **Vibrato (VIB)**: makes the operator affected by LFO vibrato.

## macros

these macros allow you to control several parameters of FM per tick.

## FM Macros

all parameters are listed above.

## OP1-OP4 Macros

all parameters are listed above.

## Macros

- **Volume**: volume sequence.
- **Arpeggio**: pitch sequence.
- **Panning**: enables output on left/right/rear channels. OPL3 only.
- **Pitch**: fine pitch.
  - **Relative**: when enabled, pitch changes are relative to the current pitch.
- **Phase Reset**: restarts all operators and resets the waveform to its start.

## OPL (drums) instrument editor

this is similar to the OPL instrument editor, but sets the parameters of snare, tom, top and hi-hat directly once a drums instrument is activated.
