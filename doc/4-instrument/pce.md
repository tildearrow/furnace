# NEC PC Engine instrument editor

The PCE instrument editor consists of these macros:

- **Volume**: volume sequence
- **Arpeggio**: pitch in half-steps
- **Noise**: enable noise mode (ch5 and ch6 only)
- **Waveform**: wavetable sequence
- **Panning (left)**: output level for left channel
- **Panning (right)**: output level for right channel
- **Pitch**: fine pitch
- **Phase Reset**: trigger restart of waveform

It also has wavetable synthesizer support, but unfortunately, it clicks a lot when in use on the HuC6280.
