# VIC-20 instrument editor

- **Volume**: volume sequence
- **Arpeggio**: pitch sequence, but in semitones
- **On/Off**: whether the channel is on or off. this is needed on the VIC because it has no per-channel volume control or ADSR.
- **Waveform**: selects anywhere a waveform from 0 to 15. waveforms 8-15 are mirrors of waveforms 0-7
- **Pitch**: standard fine pitch macro
