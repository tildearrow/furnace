# Konami K007232

a 2-channel PCM sound chip from Konami which was used in some of their 1986-1990 arcade boards.

its sample format is unique; the topmost bit is the end marker, and the low 7 bits are used for generating sound (unsigned format).

it has 7 bit digital output per each channel and no volume register on chip, so it needs external logic to control channel volume.
