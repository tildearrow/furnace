# Yamaha OPZ (YM2414)

**disclaimer: despite the name, this has nothing to do with teenage engineering's OP-Z synth!**

this is the YM2151's little-known successor, used in the Yamaha TX81Z and a few other Yamaha synthesizers. oh, and the Korg Z3 too.

it adds these features on top of the YM2151:
- 8 waveforms (but they're different from the OPL ones)
- per-channel (possibly) linear volume control separate from TL
- increased multiplier precision (in 1/16ths)
- 4-step envelope generator shift (minimum TL)
- another LFO
- no per-operator key on/off
- fixed frequency mode per operator (kind of like OPN family's extended channel mode but with a bit less precision and for all 8 channels)
- "reverb" effect (actually extends release)

unlike the YM2151, this chip is officially undocumented. very few efforts have been made to study the chip and document it...
therefore emulation of this chip in Furnace is incomplete and uncertain.

no plans have been made for TX81Z MIDI passthrough, because:
- Furnace works with register writes rather than MIDI commands
- the MIDI protocol is slow (would not be enough).
- the TX81Z is very slow to process a note on/off or parameter change event.
- the TL range has been reduced to 0-99, but the chip goes from 0-127.

- `27xx`: **set LFO 2 PM depth.**
- `28xy`: **set reverb of operator.**
  - `x` is the operator (1-4). a value of `0` means "all operators".
  - `y` is the value.
- `2Axy`: **set waveform of operator.**
  - `x` is the operator (1-4). a value of `0` means "all operators".
  - `y` is the value.
- `2Bxy`: **set EG shift of operator.**

  - `x` is the operator (1-4). a value of `0` means "all operators".
  - `y` is the value.
- `2Fxx`: **enable envelope hard reset.**
  - this works by inserting a quick release and tiny delay before a new note.
- `3xyy`: **set fixed frequency of operator 1/2.**
  - `x` is the block (`0-7` for operator 1; `8-F` for operator 2).
  - `y` is the frequency. fixed frequency mode will be disabled if this is less than 8.
  - the actual frequency is: `y*(2^x)`.
- `4xyy`: **set fixed frequency of operator 3/4.**
  - `x` is the block (`0-7` for operator 3; `8-F` for operator 4).
  - `y` is the frequency. fixed frequency mode will be disabled if this is less than 8.
  - the actual frequency is: `y*(2^x)`.
- `50xy`: **set AM of operator.**
  - `x` is the operator (1-4). a value of `0` means "all operators".
  - `y` determines whether AM is on.
