# Yamaha YMU759

the Yamaha YMU759 is a sound chip designed for feature phones during the early 2000s.
it is also known as MA-2.

sadly Yamaha didn't care about these chips too much, and the register specs were completely unavailable, which means the YMU759 is totally unsupported and unemulated besides Yamaha's official emulator for it built into MidRadio.

Furnace 0.6 loads DefleMask modules written for this system; however, it doesn't support any of its effects and is simulated using the OPL core.

since this chip is so abandoned, there isn't any support for it.

even DefleMask dropped support for the chip in version 0.11, which just shows how poorly the chip has been treated, both by Yamaha themselves and the community.


hey, at least it was the spark that ignited the idea of DefleMask.
