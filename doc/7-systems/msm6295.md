# OKI MSM6295

an upgrade from 6258 - it provides 4 ADPCM channels, at max 32 KHz (still no variable pitch though). between late '80s and late '90s, it was one of the most common, if not _the_ most common soundchip used in arcade machines (Capcom, Toaplan, Kaneko, Atari, Tecmo, the list can go on and on...)

- `20xx`: **set chip output rate.**
