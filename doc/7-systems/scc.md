# Konami SCC/SCC+

the Sound Creative Chip (SCC) adds 5 channels of wavetable to your MSX!
it was used in (of course) several Konami games, which had better audio quality due to the extra channels provided by this chip (poor AY since nobody used the envelope for bass).

the only problem? the waveform of the fourth channel is shared with the fifth one due to not enough memory in the chip!
the SCC+ fixes this issue though (while being compatible with SCC games).
