# Irem GA20

it is a 4 channel PCM sound source used by Irem in their arcades in late 1980s and early 1990s, often paired with [Yamaha YM2151](ym2151.md).

the sound chip itself is rather unremarkable, having 8-bit volume and pitch control and no stereo panning...

let's be honest. Furnace has too many chips and a great portion of them are sample chips that do the same task: playing back samples.

## effects

this chip has no added effects.

## info

this chip uses the [GA20](../4-instrument/ga20.md) instrument type.
