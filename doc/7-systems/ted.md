# MOS Technology TED

also called 7360/8360, TED stands for Text Editing Device. it's both a video and audio chip of Commodore budget computers, like Plus/4 and 16. 

its audio portion is pretty barren - only 2 channels. one can output square wave and other may be either square or noise.
pitch range is limited as well, akin to that of SN76489, and volume control is global.

none so far.
