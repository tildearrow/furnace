# Namco C219

Namco C219 is a 16-channel PCM sound chip that's a lot like C140, but has a noise generator, surround effect and a different µ-law curve.

this chip features:

- stereo soft panning
- accepts either 8-bit PCM or proprietary 8-bit µ-law compressed PCM samples

## sample memory notice

this chip is rather unique when it comes to sample memory. be sure to read this notice.

the channels are in groups of four. a sample bank (128KB) may be selected for each group.
if a sample that is on a different bank plays in a group, the group is switched to that bank, and other channels will be silenced.

## effects

- `11xx`: **set noise mode.**
- `12xy`: **set invert mode.**
  - if `x` is 1 or higher, surround is enabled.
  - if `y` is 1 or higher, invert is enabled.

## info

this chip uses the [C219](../4-instrument/c219.md) instrument editor.

maximum sample length is 131072, and loop start and end points must be even numbers.
