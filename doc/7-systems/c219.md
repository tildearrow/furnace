# Namco C219

Namco C219 is a 16-channel PCM sound chip that's a lot like C140, but has a noise generator, surround effect and a different µ-law curve.

this chip features:

- stereo soft panning
- accepts either 8-bit PCM or proprietary 8-bit µ-law compressed PCM samples

## effects

- `11xx`: **set noise mode.**
- `12xy`: **set invert mode.**
  - if `x` is 1 or higher, surround is enabled.
  - if `y` is 1 or higher, invert is enabled.

## info

this chip uses the [C219](../4-instrument/c219.md) instrument editor.
