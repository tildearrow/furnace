# unofficial packages
[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/tiny-repos/furnace.svg)](https://repology.org/project/furnace/versions)

some people have provided packages for Unix/Unix-like distributions. here's a list.

## Arch Linux

[furnace-git is in the AUR.](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/furnace-git) thank you Essem!

## FreeBSD

[a package in ports](https://www.freshports.org/audio/furnace/) is available courtesy of ehaupt.

## Nix

(TODO)

# developer info

**NOTE: do not download the project's source as a .zip or .tar.gz as these do not include the project's submodules which are necessary to proceed with building.**

## dependencies

- CMake
- SDL2
- zlib
- JACK (optional)

SDL2 and zlib are included as submodules.

## getting the source

type the following on a terminal/console: (make sure Git is installed)

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace.git
cd furnace
```

(the `--recursive` parameter ensures submodules are fetched as well)

## compilation

your typical CMake project.

### Windows using MSVC

as of now tildearrow uses MinGW for Windows builds, but thanks to OPNA2608 this works again!

from the developer tools command prompt:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
```

### macOS and Linux

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### CMake options

To add an option from the command-line: `-D<NAME>=<VALUE>`  
Example: `cmake -DBUILD_GUI=OFF -DWARNINGS_ARE_ERRORS=ON ..`

Available options:

| Name | Default | Description |
| :--: | :-----: | ----------- |
| `BUILD_GUI` | `ON` if not building for Android, otherwise `OFF` | Build the tracker (disable to build only a headless player) |
| `WITH_JACK` | `ON` if system-installed JACK detected, otherwise `OFF` | Whether to build with JACK support. Auto-detects if JACK is available |
| `SYSTEM_FMT` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of fmt instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_LIBSNDFILE` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of libsndfile instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_ZLIB` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of zlib instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_SDL2` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of SDL2 instead of the vendored one |
| `WARNINGS_ARE_ERRORS` | `OFF` (but consider enabling this & reporting any errors that arise from it!) | Whether warnings in furnace's C++ code should be treated as errors |

## usage

```
./furnace
```

this opens the program.

```
./furnace -console <file>
```

this will play a compatible file.

```
./furnace -console -view commands <file>
```

this will play a compatible file and enable the commands view.

# notes

> how do I use Neo Geo SSG envelopes?

the following effects are provided:

- `22xy`: set envelope mode.
  - `x` sets the envelope shape, which may be one of the following:
    - `0: \___` decay
    - `4: /___` attack once
    - `8: \\\\` saw
    - `9: \___` decay
    - `A: \/\/` inverse obelisco
    - `B: \¯¯¯` decay once
    - `C: ////` inverse saw
    - `D: /¯¯¯` attack
    - `E: /\/\` obelisco
    - `F: /___` attack once
  - if `y` is 1 then the envelope will affect this channel.
- `23xx`: set envelope period low byte.
- `24xx`: set envelope period high byte.
- `25xx`: slide envelope period up.
- `26xx`: slide envelope period down.

a lower envelope period will make the envelope run faster.

> how do I use C64 absolute filter/duty?

on Instrument Editor in the C64 tab there are two options to toggle these.
also provided are two effects:

- `3xxx`: set fine duty.
- `4xxx`: set fine cutoff. `xxx` range is 000-7ff.

> how do I use PCM on a PCM-capable system?

Two possibilities: the recommended way is via creating the "Amiga/Sample" type instrument and assigning sample to it, or via old, Deflemask-compatible method, using `17xx` effect

> my song sounds very odd at a certain point

file a bug report. use the Issues page.

it's probably another playback inaccuracy.

> my song sounds correct, but it doesn't in DefleMask

file a bug report **here**. it still is a playback inaccuracy.

> my C64 song sounds terrible after saving as .dmf!

that's a limitation of the DefleMask format. save in Furnace song format instead (.fur).

> how do I solo channels?

right click on the channel name.
