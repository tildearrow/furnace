# developer info

[![Build furnace](https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace/actions/workflows/build.yml)

if you can't download these artifacts (because GitHub requires you to be logged in), [go here](https://nightly.link/tildearrow/furnace/workflows/build/master) instead.

**NOTE: do not download the project's source as a .zip or .tar.gz as these do not include the project's submodules which are necessary to proceed with building. please instead use Git as shown below.**

## dependencies

- CMake
- JACK (optional, macOS/Linux only)

if building under Windows or macOS, no additional dependencies are required.
otherwise, you may also need the following:

- libpulse
- libx11
- libasound
- libGL

some Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu or openSUSE) will require you to install the `-dev` versions of these.

## getting the source

type the following on a terminal/console: (make sure Git is installed)

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace.git
cd furnace
```

(the `--recursive` parameter ensures submodules are fetched as well)

## compilation

your typical CMake project.

### Windows using MSVC

as of now tildearrow uses MinGW for Windows builds, but thanks to OPNA2608 this works again!

from the developer tools command prompt:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
```

### macOS and Linux

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Alternatively, build scripts are provided in the `scripts/` folder in the root of the repository.

### CMake options

To add an option from the command-line: `-D<NAME>=<VALUE>`  
Example: `cmake -DBUILD_GUI=OFF -DWARNINGS_ARE_ERRORS=ON ..`

Available options:

| Name | Default | Description |
| :--: | :-----: | ----------- |
| `BUILD_GUI` | `ON` | Build the tracker (disable to build only a headless player) |
| `USE_RTMIDI` | `ON` | Build with MIDI support using RtMidi |
| `USE_SDL2` | `ON` | Build with SDL2 (required to build with GUI) |
| `USE_SNDFILE` | `ON` | Build with libsndfile (required in order to work with audio files) |
| `USE_BACKWARD` | `ON` | Use backward-cpp to print a backtrace on crash/abort |
| `WITH_JACK` | `ON` if system-installed JACK detected, otherwise `OFF` | Whether to build with JACK support. Auto-detects if JACK is available |
| `SYSTEM_FFTW` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of FFTW instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_FMT` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of fmt instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_LIBSNDFILE` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of libsndfile instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_RTMIDI` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of RtMidi instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_ZLIB` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of zlib instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_SDL2` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of SDL2 instead of the vendored one |
| `SUPPORT_XP` | `OFF` | Build a Windows XP-compatible binary |
| `WARNINGS_ARE_ERRORS` | `OFF` (but consider enabling this & reporting any errors that arise from it!) | Whether warnings in furnace's C++ code should be treated as errors |
| `WITH_DEMOS` | `ON` | Install demo songs on `make install` |
| `WITH_INSTRUMENTS` | `ON` | Install demo instruments on `make install` |
| `WITH_WAVETABLES` | `ON` | Install wavetables on `make install` |

## console usage

```
./furnace
```

this opens the program.

```
./furnace -console <file>
```

this will play a compatible file.

```
./furnace -console -view commands <file>
```

this will play a compatible file and enable the commands view.

**note that these commands only actually work in Linux environments. on other command lines, such as Windows' Command Prompt, or MacOS Terminal, it may not work correctly.**

# frequently asked questions

> woah! 50 sound chips?! I can't believe it!

yup, it's real.

> where's the manual?

see [papers/](papers/doc/README.md). it's kind of incomplete, but at least the sound chips section is there.

> it doesn't open under macOS!

this is due to Apple's application signing policy. a workaround is to right click on the Furnace app icon and select Open.

**as of Monterey, this workaround no longer works (especially on ARM).** yeah, Apple has decided to be strict on the matter.
if you happen to be on that version, use this workaround instead (on a Terminal):

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Furnace.app
```

(replace /path/to/ with the path where Furnace.app is located)

you may need to log out and/or reboot after doing this.

> .spc export?

**not yet!** coming in 0.7 though, eventually...

> how do I use C64 absolute filter/duty?

on Instrument Editor in the C64 tab there are two options to toggle these.
also provided are two effects:

- `3xxx`: set fine duty.
- `4xxx`: set fine cutoff. `xxx` range is 000-7ff.
additionally, you can change the cutoff and/or duty as a macro inside an instrument by clicking the `absolute cutoff macro` and/or `absolute duty macro` checkbox at the bottom of the instrument. (for the filter, you also need to click the checkbox that says `volume macro is cutoff macro`.)

> how do I use PCM on a PCM-capable chip?

two possibilities:
- the recommended way is by creating the "Sample" type instrument and assigning a sample to it.
- otherwise you may employ the DefleMask-compatible method, using `17xx` effect.

> my .dmf song sounds odd at a certain point

Furnace's .dmf compatibility isn't perfect and it's mostly because DefleMask does things different.

> my song sounds terrible after saving as .dmf!

you should only save as .dmf if you're really sure, because the DefleMask format has several limitations. save in Furnace song format instead (.fur).

> how do I solo channels?

right click on the channel name.
