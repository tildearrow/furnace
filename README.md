# developer info

[![Build furnace](https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace/actions/workflows/build.yml)

if you can't download these artifacts (because GitHub requires you to be logged in), [go here](https://nightly.link/tildearrow/furnace/workflows/build/master) instead.

**NOTE: do not download the project's source as a .zip or .tar.gz as these do not include the project's submodules which are necessary to proceed with building. please instead use Git as shown below.**

## dependencies

- CMake
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- JACK (optional, macOS/Linux only)
- a C/C++ compiler (e.g. Visual Studio or MinGW on Windows, Xcode (the command-line tools are enough) on macOS or GCC on Linux)

if building under Windows or macOS, no additional dependencies are required.
otherwise, you may also need the following:

- libpulse
- libx11
- libasound
- libGL
- any other libraries which may be used by SDL

some Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu or openSUSE) will require you to install the `-dev` versions of these.

## getting the source

type the following on a terminal/console: (make sure Git is installed)

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace.git
cd furnace
```

(the `--recursive` parameter ensures submodules are fetched as well)

## compilation

your typical CMake project.

### Windows using MSVC

as of now tildearrow uses MinGW for Windows builds, but thanks to OPNA2608 this works again!

from the developer tools command prompt:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

then open the solution file in Visual Studio and build.

alternatively, do:

```
msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
```

### Windows using MinGW

setting up MinGW is a bit more complicated. two benefits are a faster, hotter Furnace, and Windows XP support.

however, one huge drawback is lack of backtrace support, so you'll have to use gdb when diagnosing a crash.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
mingw32-make
```

you may use "MSYS Makefiles" instead, depending on how you installed MinGW.

### macOS, Linux and other Unix/Unix-like

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

on macOS you may do the following instead:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Xcode ..
```

...and then load the project on Xcode or type `xcodebuild`.

### CMake options

To add an option from the command-line: `-D<NAME>=<VALUE>`  
Example: `cmake -DBUILD_GUI=OFF -DWARNINGS_ARE_ERRORS=ON ..`

Available options:

| Name | Default | Description |
| :--: | :-----: | ----------- |
| `BUILD_GUI` | `ON` | Build the tracker (disable to build only a headless player) |
| `USE_RTMIDI` | `ON` | Build with MIDI support using RtMidi |
| `USE_SDL2` | `ON` | Build with SDL2 (required to build with GUI) |
| `USE_SNDFILE` | `ON` | Build with libsndfile (required in order to work with audio files) |
| `USE_BACKWARD` | `ON` | Use backward-cpp to print a backtrace on crash/abort |
| `WITH_JACK` | `ON` if system-installed JACK detected, otherwise `OFF` | Whether to build with JACK support. Auto-detects if JACK is available |
| `SYSTEM_FFTW` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of FFTW instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_FMT` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of fmt instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_LIBSNDFILE` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of libsndfile instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_RTMIDI` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of RtMidi instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_ZLIB` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of zlib instead of the vendored one |
| `SYSTEM_SDL2` | `OFF` | Use a system-installed version of SDL2 instead of the vendored one |
| `SUPPORT_XP` | `OFF` | Build a Windows XP-compatible binary |
| `WARNINGS_ARE_ERRORS` | `OFF` (but consider enabling this & reporting any errors that arise from it!) | Whether warnings in furnace's C++ code should be treated as errors |
| `WITH_DEMOS` | `ON` | Install demo songs on `make install` |
| `WITH_INSTRUMENTS` | `ON` | Install demo instruments on `make install` |
| `WITH_WAVETABLES` | `ON` | Install wavetables on `make install` |

## CMake Error

if it says something about a missing subdirectory in `extern`, then either:

1. you didn't set up submodules, or
2. you downloaded the source as a .zip or .tar.gz. don't do this.

if 1, you may run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. this will initialize submodules.

if 2, clone this repo.

## console usage

(note: if on Windows, type `furnace.exe` instead, or `Debug\furnace.exe` on MSVC)

```
./furnace
```

this opens the program.

```
./furnace -console <file>
```

this will play a compatible file.

```
./furnace -console -view commands <file>
```

this will play a compatible file and enable the commands view.

**note that console mode may not work correctly on Windows. you may have to quit using the Task Manager.**

# frequently asked questions

> it doesn't open under macOS!

this is due to Apple's application signing policy. a workaround is to right click on the Furnace app icon and select Open.

> it says "Furnace" is damaged and can't be opened!

**as of Monterey, this workaround no longer works (especially on ARM).** yeah, Apple has decided to be strict on the matter.
if you happen to be on that version (or later), use this workaround instead (on a Terminal):

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Furnace.app
```

(replace /path/to/ with the path where Furnace.app is located)

you may need to log out and/or reboot after doing this.

> where's the manual?

it is in [doc/](doc/README.md).

> is there a tutorial?

sadly, the in-program tutorial isn't ready yet. however, [a video tutorial is available on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCELB6AsTZUnwv0PC5AAGHjvg47F44YQ1), made by Spinning Square Waves.

> I've lost my song!

Furnace keeps backups of the songs you've worked on before. go to **file > restore backup**.

> .spc export?

**not yet!** coming in 0.7 though, eventually...

> ROM export?

**not yet!** coming in 0.7 though, eventually...

> my .dmf song sounds odd at a certain point

Furnace's .dmf compatibility isn't perfect and it's mostly because DefleMask does things different.

> my song sounds terrible after saving as .dmf!

you should only save as .dmf if you're really sure, because the DefleMask format has several limitations. save in Furnace song format instead (.fur).
