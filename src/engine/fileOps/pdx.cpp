//PDX 8-bit OKI ADPCM sample bank

/* File format
The file starts with a header with 96 8-byte pairs, with each pair containing offset and length of ADPCM data chunks for each note value, like so:

[[byte pointer to sample in file -- 32-bit unsigned integer (4 bytes)] [empty: $0000 -- 16-bit integer] [length of sample, amount in bytes -- 16-bit unsigned integer] Ã—96] [ADPCM data] EOF

The first sample (1) is mapped to 0x80 (= the lowest note within MXDRV) and the last sample (96) is mapped to 0xDF (= the highest note within MXDRV).


Samples are encoded in 4-bit OKI ADPCM encoded nibbles, where each byte contains 2 nibbles: [nibble 2 << 4 || nibble 1]


Unfortunately, sample rates for each samples are not defined within the .PDX file and have to be set manually with the appropriate command for that at play-time */
