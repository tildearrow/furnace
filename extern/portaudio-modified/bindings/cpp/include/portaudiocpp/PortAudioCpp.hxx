/// <h1>PortAudioCpp - A Native C++ Binding of PortAudio V19</h1>
/// <h2>PortAudio</h2>
/// <p>
///   PortAudio is a portable and mature C API for accessing audio hardware. It offers both callback-based and blocking
///   style input and output, deals with sample data format conversions, dithering and much more. There are a large number
///   of implementations available for various platforms including Windows MME, Windows DirectX, Windows and MacOS (Classic)
///   ASIO, MacOS Classic SoundManager, MacOS X CoreAudio, OSS (Linux), Linux ALSA, JACK (MacOS X and Linux) and SGI Irix
///   AL. Note that, currently not all of these implementations are equally complete or up-to-date (as PortAudio V19 is
///   still in development). Because PortAudio has a C API, it can easily be called from a variety of other programming
///   languages.
/// </p>
/// <h2>PortAudioCpp</h2>
/// <p>
///   Although, it is possible to use PortAudio's C API from within a C++ program, this is usually a little awkward
///   as procedural and object-oriented paradigms need to be mixed. PortAudioCpp aims to resolve this by encapsulating
///   PortAudio's C API to form an equivalent object-oriented C++ API. It provides a more natural integration of PortAudio
///   into C++ programs as well as a more structured interface. PortAudio's concepts were preserved as much as possible and
///   no additional features were added except for some `convenience methods'.
/// </p>
/// <p>
///   PortAudioCpp's main features are:
///   <ul>
///     <li>Structured object model.</li>
///     <li>C++ exception handling instead of C-style error return codes.</li>
///     <li>Handling of callbacks using free functions (C and C++), static functions, member functions or instances of classes
///     derived from a given interface.</li>
///     <li>STL compliant iterators to host APIs and devices.</li>
///     <li>Some additional convenience functions to more easily set up and use PortAudio.</li>
///   </ul>
/// </p>
/// <p>
///   PortAudioCpp requires a recent version of the PortAudio V19 source code. This can be obtained from CVS or as a snapshot
///   from the website. The examples also require the ASIO 2 SDK which can be obtained from the Steinberg website. Alternatively, the
///   examples can easily be modified to compile without needing ASIO.
/// </p>
/// <p>
///   Supported platforms:
///   <ul>
///     <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, 7.0 (.NET 2002) and 7.1 (.NET 2003).</li>
///     <li>GNU G++ 2.95 and G++ 3.3.</li>
///   </ul>
///   Other platforms should be easily supported as PortAudioCpp is platform-independent and (reasonably) C++ standard compliant.
/// </p>
/// <p>
///   This documentation mainly provides information specific to PortAudioCpp. For a more complete explanation of all of the
///   concepts used, please consult the PortAudio documentation.
/// </p>
/// <p>
///   PortAudioCpp was developed by Merlijn Blaauw with many great suggestions and help from Ross Bencina. Ludwig Schwardt provided
///   GNU/Linux build files and checked G++ compatibility. PortAudioCpp may be used under the same licensing, conditions and
///   warranty as PortAudio. See <a href="http://www.portaudio.com/license.html">the PortAudio license</a> for more details.
