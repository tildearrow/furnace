# libsndfile Mailing Lists

**Note**: These mailing lists are not maintained by the libsndfile team anymore.
Use [GitHub issues and pull requests instead](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).

There are three mailing lists for libsndfile:

 - **libsndfile-announce@mega-nerd.com**  
  [Subscribe](mailto:libsndfile-announce-request@mega-nerd.com?subject=subscribe)  
  A list which will announce each new release of libsndfile. No one can
  post to this list except the author.  
- **libsndfile-devel@mega-nerd.com**  
  [Subscribe](mailto:libsndfile-devel-request@mega-nerd.com?subject=subscribe)  
  A list for discussing bugs, porting issues and feature requests.
  Posting is restricted to subscribers.  
- **libsndfile-users@mega-nerd.com**  
  [Subscribe](mailto:libsndfile-users-request@mega-nerd.com?subject=subscribe)  
  A list for discussing the use of libsndfile in other programs.
  Posting is restricted to subscribers.  

The libsndfile-devel and libsndfile-users list will automatically receive a copy
of all emails to the libsndfile-announce list.
