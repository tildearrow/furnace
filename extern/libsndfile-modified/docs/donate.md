Dear libsndfile user,

This library was developed on Linux for Linux. I am not a Windows user and
maintaining this library for Windows costs me significant amounts of time above
and beyond the time taken to make it work on Linux and Unix-like systems.

I therefore ask Windows users of libsndfile to donate to ensure that
libsndfile's support for Windows continues. As long as donations continue to
flow in at a decentrate, I will continue to release precompiled Windows binaries
in sync with the Linux/Unix version. If donations are poor, support for windows
will fall behind.

You are free to donate any amount you chose. As a guideline:

* If you are simply a user of libsndfile that would like to ensure that the
  development of libsndfile continues, a donation of $10US would be more than
  adequate.
* If you are shareware author that distributes libsndfile with your app and
  makes more than $1000 a year from your shareware, a one off donation of $50
  would be appropriate.
* If your company is a commercial software house that distributes one or more
  products that ship with libsndfile, a donation of $100 every second or third
  year would be appropriate.
