# libsndfile Development

libsndfile is being developed by a small community of users and hackers. People
interested in helping can raise an issue on Github.

The main repository can be found on Github:

<https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/>

and includes [instructions](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/blob/master/README.md)
on how to build libsndfile from the Git repo.

If you are interested in how to add a new format to a libsndfile, you may find
this [FAQ](new_file_type_howto.md) helpful.
