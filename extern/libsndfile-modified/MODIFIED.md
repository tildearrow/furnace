NOTICE: THIS IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF LIBSNDFILE WHICH FIXES COMPILATION WHEN USING CMAKE 4.0.

I can't believe I had to desubmodulize this just for a ONE CHARACTER change.
no, I couldn't use Git master as they've dropped support for early 3.x CMake.

this is commit 72f6af15e8f85157bd622ed45b979025828b7001 (tag 1.2.2).
