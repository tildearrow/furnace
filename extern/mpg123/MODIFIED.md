# Modification Disclaimer

certain files have been modified to suit Furnace's needs, such as disabling integration with specific libraries, disabling certain options which are not necessary (such as doc generation) or allowing libsndfile to link against this library.

in particular, the build system is heavily modified as it simply did not permit compilation as a static library, let alone linking against libsndfile.

changes are preceded by "tildearrow".
