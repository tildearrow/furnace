Changes in version 1.0.1:
- Fixed comment tags which were outputing as '<?--' instead of 
  the correct '<!--'.
- Implemented the Next and Prev methods of the TiXmlAttribute class.
- Renamed 'LastAttribtute' to 'LastAttribute'
- Fixed bad pointer to 'isspace' that could occur while parsing text.
- Errors finding beginning and end of tags no longer throw it into an
  infinite loop. (Hopefully.)

Changes in version 1.0.2
- Minor documentation fixes.

Changes in version 1.0.3
- After nodes are added to a document, they return a pointer
  to the new node instead of a bool for success.
- Elements can be constructed with a value, which is the
  element name. Every element must have a value or it will be
  invalid, but the code changes to enforce this are not fully
  in place.

Changes in version 1.1.0
- Added the	TiXmlAttributeSet class to pull the attributes into
  a seperate container.
- Moved the doubly liked list out of XmlBase. Now XmlBase only
  requires the Print() function and defines some utility functions.
- Moved errors into a seperate file. (With the idea of internationalization
  to the other latin-1 languages.)
- Added the "NodeType"
- Fixed white space parsing in text to conform with the standard. 
  Basically, all white space becomes just one space.
- Added the TiXmlDeclaration class to read xml declarations.

Changes in version 1.2.0
- Removed the factory. The factory was not really in the spirit 
  of small and simple, confused the code, and was of limited value.
- Added FirstChildElement and NextSiblingElement, because they
  are such common functions.
- Re-wrote the example to test and demonstrate more functionality.

Changes in version 1.2.1
- Fixed a bug where comments couldn't be inside elements.
- Loading now clears out existing XML rather than appending.
- Added the "Clear" method on a node to delete all its children.

Changes in version 1.2.2
- Fixed TiXmlAttribute::Previous actually returning "next." Thanks
  to Rickard Troedsson for the bug fix.

Changes in version 1.2.3
- Added the TIXML prefix to the error strings to resolve conflicts
  with #defines in OS headers. Thanks to Steve Lhomme.
- Fixed a delete buf that should be a delete [] buf. 
  Thanks to Ephi Sinowitz.

Changes in version 1.2.4
- ReplaceChild() was almost guarenteed to fail. Should be fixed,
  thanks to Joe Smith. Joe also pointed out that the Print() functions
  should take stream references: I agree, and would like to overload
  the Print() method to take either format, but I don't want to do 
  this in a dot release.
- Some compilers seem to need an extra <ctype.h> include. Thanks
  to Steve Lhomme for that.

Changes in version 2.0.0
- Made the ToXXX() casts safe if 'this' is null. 
  When "LoadFile" is called with a filename, the value will correctly get set.
  Thanks to Brian Yoder.
- Fixed bug where isalpha() and isalnum() would get called with a negative value for 
  high ascii numbers. Thanks to Alesky Aksenov.
- Fixed some errors codes that were not getting set.
- Made methods "const" that were not.
- Added a switch to enable or disable the ignoring of white space. ( TiXmlDocument::SetIgnoreWhiteSpace() )
- Greater standardization and code re-use in the parser.
- Added a stream out operator.
- Added a stream in operator.
- Entity support.

TODO
CDATA.
Support for "generic entity" #xxx thing.
