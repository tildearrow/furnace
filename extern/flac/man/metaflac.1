.SH NAME
.PP
metaflac - program to list, add, remove, or edit metadata in one or more
FLAC files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]metaflac\f[R] [ \f[I]options\f[R] ] [ \f[I]operations\f[R] ]
\f[I]FLACfile \&...\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Use \f[B]metaflac\f[R] to list, add, remove, or edit metadata in one or
more FLAC files.
You may perform one major operation, or many shorthand operations at a
time.
.SH GENERAL USAGE
.PP
metaflac is the command-line .flac file metadata editor.
You can use it to list the contents of metadata blocks, edit, delete or
insert blocks, and manage padding.
.PP
metaflac takes a set of \[lq]options\[rq] (though some are not optional)
and a set of FLAC files to operate on.
There are three kinds of \[lq]options\[rq]:
.IP \[bu] 2
Major operations, which specify a mode of operation like listing blocks,
removing blocks, etc.
These will have sub-operations describing exactly what is to be done.
.IP \[bu] 2
Shorthand operations, which are convenient synonyms for major
operations.
For example, there is a shorthand operation --show-sample-rate that
shows just the sample rate field from the STREAMINFO metadata block.
.IP \[bu] 2
Global options, which affect all the operations.
.PP
All of these are described in the tables below.
At least one shorthand or major operation must be supplied.
You can use multiple shorthand operations to do more than one thing to a
file or set of files.
Most of the common things to do to metadata have shorthand operations.
As an example, here is how to show the MD5 signatures for a set of three
FLAC files:
.PP
\f[V]metaflac --show-md5sum file1.flac file2.flac file3.flac\f[R]
.PP
Another example; this removes all DESCRIPTION and COMMENT tags in a set
of FLAC files, and uses the --preserve-modtime global option to keep the
FLAC file modification times the same (usually when files are edited the
modification time is set to the current time):
.PP
\f[V]metaflac --preserve-modtime --remove-tag=DESCRIPTION --remove-tag=COMMENT file1.flac file2.flac file3.flac\f[R]
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]-o\f[R] \f[I]filename\f[R]\f[B], --output-name=\f[R]\f[I]filename\f[R]
Output to a new file instead of changing or rewriting the input file.
.TP
\f[B]--preserve-modtime\f[R]
Preserve the original modification time in spite of edits.
This does nothing when -o or \[en]output-name are specified.
.TP
\f[B]--with-filename\f[R]
Prefix each output line with the FLAC file name (the default if more
than one FLAC file is specified).
This option has no effect for options exporting to a file, like
--export-tags-to.
.TP
\f[B]--no-filename\f[R]
Do not prefix each output line with the FLAC file name (the default if
only one FLAC file is specified).
.TP
\f[B]--no-utf8-convert\f[R]
Do not convert tags from UTF-8 to local charset, or vice versa.
This is useful for scripts, and setting tags in situations where the
locale is wrong.
.TP
\f[B]--dont-use-padding\f[R]
By default metaflac tries to use padding where possible to avoid
rewriting the entire file if the metadata size changes.
Use this option to tell metaflac to not take advantage of padding this
way.
.SH SHORTHAND OPERATIONS
.TP
\f[B]--show-md5sum\f[R]
Show the MD5 signature from the STREAMINFO block.

Show the vendor string from the VORBIS_COMMENT block.
.TP
\f[B]--show-tag=name\f[R]
Show all tags where the field name matches `name'.
.TP
\f[B]--show-all-tags\f[R]
Show all tags.
This is an alias for --export-tags-to=-.
.TP
\f[B]--remove-tag=name\f[R]
Remove all tags whose field name is `name'.
.TP
\f[B]--remove-first-tag=name\f[R]
Remove first tag whose field name is `name'.
.TP
\f[B]--remove-all-tags\f[R]
Remove all tags, leaving only the vendor string.
.TP
\f[B]--remove-all-tags-except=NAME1[=NAME2[=\&...]]\f[R]
Remove all tags, except the vendor string and the tag names specified.
Tag names must be separated by an = character.
.TP
\f[B]--set-tag=field\f[R]
Add a tag.
The field must comply with the Vorbis comment spec, of the form
\[lq]NAME=VALUE\[rq].
If there is currently no tag block, one will be created.
.TP
\f[B]--set-tag-from-file=field\f[R]
Like --set-tag, except the VALUE is a filename whose contents will be
read verbatim to set the tag value.
Unless --no-utf8-convert is specified, the contents will be converted to
UTF-8 from the local charset.
This can be used to store a cuesheet in a tag (e.g.
--set-tag-from-file=\[lq]CUESHEET=image.cue\[rq]).
Do not try to store binary data in tag fields!
Use APPLICATION blocks for that.
.TP
\f[B]--import-tags-from=file\f[R]
Import tags from a file.
Use `-' for stdin.
Each line should be of the form NAME=VALUE.
Multi-line comments are currently not supported.
Specify --remove-all-tags and/or --no-utf8-convert before
--import-tags-from if necessary.
If FILE is `-' (stdin), only one FLAC file may be specified.
.TP
\f[B]--export-tags-to=file\f[R]
Export tags to a file.
Use `-' for stdout.
Each line will be of the form NAME=VALUE.
Specify --no-utf8-convert if necessary.
.TP
\f[B]--import-cuesheet-from=file\f[R]
Import a cuesheet from a file.
Use `-' for stdin.
Only one FLAC file may be specified.
A seekpoint will be added for each index point in the cuesheet to the
SEEKTABLE unless --no-cued-seekpoints is specified.
.TP
\f[B]--export-cuesheet-to=file\f[R]
Export CUESHEET block to a cuesheet file, suitable for use by CD
authoring software.
Use `-' for stdout.
Only one FLAC file may be specified on the command line.
.TP
\f[B]--import-picture-from={\f[R]\f[I]FILENAME\f[R]\f[B]|\f[R]\f[I]SPECIFICATION\f[R]\f[B]}\f[R]
Import a picture and store it in a PICTURE metadata block.
More than one --import-picture-from command can be specified.
Either a filename for the picture file or a more complete specification
form can be used.
The SPECIFICATION is a string whose parts are separated by | (pipe)
characters.
Some parts may be left empty to invoke default values.
FILENAME is just shorthand for \[lq]||||FILENAME\[rq].
For details on the specification, see the section \f[B]Picture
specification\f[R] in the \f[B]flac(1)\f[R] man page.
.TP
\f[B]--export-picture-to=file\f[R]
Export PICTURE block to a file.
Use `-' for stdout.
Only one FLAC file may be specified on the command line.
The first PICTURE block will be exported unless --export-picture-to is
preceded by a --block-number=# option to specify the exact metadata
block to extract.
Note that the block number is the one shown by --list.
.TP
\f[B]--add-replay-gain\f[R]
Calculates the title and album gains/peaks of the given FLAC files as if
all the files were part of one album, then stores them as FLAC tags.
The tags are the same as those used by vorbisgain.
Existing ReplayGain tags will be replaced.
If only one FLAC file is given, the album and title gains will be the
same.
Since this operation requires two passes, it is always executed last,
after all other operations have been completed and written to disk.
All FLAC files specified must have the same resolution, sample rate, and
number of channels.
Only mono and stereo files are allowed, and the sample rate must be 8,
11.025, 12, 16, 18.9, 22.05, 24, 28, 32, 36, 37.8, 44.1, 48, 56, 64, 72,
75.6, 88.2, 96, 112, 128, 144, 151.2, 176.4, 192, 224, 256, 288, 302.4,
352.8, 384, 448, 512, 576, or 604.8 kHz.
.TP
\f[B]--scan-replay-gain\f[R]
Like --add-replay-gain, but only analyzes the files rather than writing
them to the tags.
.TP
\f[B]--remove-replay-gain\f[R]
Removes the ReplayGain tags.
.TP
\f[B]--add-seekpoint={\f[R]\f[I]#\f[R]\f[B]|\f[R]\f[I]X\f[R]\f[B]|\f[R]\f[I]#x\f[R]\f[B]|\f[R]\f[I]#s\f[R]\f[B]}\f[R]
Add seek points to a SEEKTABLE block.
Using #, a seek point at that sample number is added.
Using X, a placeholder point is added at the end of a the table.
Using #x, # evenly spaced seek points will be added, the first being at
sample 0.
Using #s, a seekpoint will be added every # seconds (# does not have to
be a whole number; it can be, for example, 9.5, meaning a seekpoint
every 9.5 seconds).
If no SEEKTABLE block exists, one will be created.
If one already exists, points will be added to the existing table, and
any duplicates will be turned into placeholder points.
You may use many --add-seekpoint options; the resulting SEEKTABLE will
be the unique-ified union of all such values.
Example: --add-seekpoint=100x --add-seekpoint=3.5s will add 100 evenly
spaced seekpoints and a seekpoint every 3.5 seconds.
.TP
\f[B]--add-padding=length\f[R]
Add a padding block of the given length (in bytes).
The overall length of the new block will be 4 + length; the extra 4
bytes is for the metadata block header.
.SH MAJOR OPERATIONS
.TP
\f[B]--list\f[R]
List the contents of one or more metadata blocks to stdout.
By default, all metadata blocks are listed in text format.
Use the options \f[B]--block-number\f[R], \f[B]--block-type\f[R] or
\f[B]--except-block-type\f[R] to change this behavior.
.TP
\f[B]--remove\f[R]
Remove one or more metadata blocks from the metadata.
Use the options \f[B]--block-number\f[R], \f[B]--block-type\f[R] or
\f[B]--except-block-type\f[R] to specify which blocks should be removed.
Note that if both --block-number and --[except-]block-type are
specified, the result is the logical AND of both arguments.
Unless --dont-use-padding is specified, the blocks will be replaced with
padding.
You may not remove the STREAMINFO block.
.TP
\f[B]--block-number=#[,#[\&...]]\f[R]
An optional comma-separated list of block numbers to display.
The first block, the STREAMINFO block, is block 0.
.PP
\f[B]--block-type=type[,type[\&...]]\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]--except-block-type=type[,type[\&...]]\f[R]
An optional comma-separated list of block types to be included or
ignored with this option.
Use only one of --block-type or --except-block-type.
The valid block types are: STREAMINFO, PADDING, APPLICATION, SEEKTABLE,
VORBIS_COMMENT, PICTURE.
You may narrow down the types of APPLICATION blocks selected by
appending APPLICATION with a colon and the ID of the APPLICATION block
in either ASCII or hexadecimal representation.
E.g.
APPLICATION:abcd for the APPLICATION block(s) whose textual
representation of the 4-byte ID is \[lq]abcd\[rq] or
APPLICATION:0xXXXXXXXX for the APPLICATION block(s) whose hexadecimal
big- endian representation of the 4-byte ID is \[lq]0xXXXXXXXX\[rq].
For the example \[lq]abcd\[rq] above the hexadecimal equivalalent is
0x61626364
.TP
\f[B]--application-data-format=hexdump|text\f[R]
If the application block you are displaying contains binary data but
your --data-format=text, you can display a hex dump of the application
data contents instead using --application-data-format=hexdump.
.TP
\f[B]--data-format=binary|binary-headerless|text\f[R]
For use with --list.
By default a human-readable text representation of the data is isplayed.
You may specify --data-format=binary to dump the raw binary form of each
metadata block.
Specify --data-format=binary-headerless to omit output of metadata block
headers, including the id of APPLICATION metadata blocks.
.TP
\f[B]--append\f[R]
Insert a metadata block from a file.
This must be a binary block as exported with --list
--data-format=binary.
The insertion point is defined with --block-number=#.
The new block will be added after the given block number.
This prevents the illegal insertion of a block before the first
STREAMINFO block.
You may not --append another STREAMINFO block.
It is possible to copy a metadata block from one file to another with
this option.
For example use
\f[V]metaflac --list --data-format=binary --block-number=6 file.flac > block\f[R]
to export the block, and then import it with
\f[V]metaflac --append anotherfile.flac < block\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]--remove-all\f[R]
Remove all metadata blocks (except the STREAMINFO block) from the
metadata.
Unless --dont-use-padding is specified, the blocks will be replaced with
padding.
.TP
\f[B]--merge-padding\f[R]
Merge adjacent PADDING blocks into single blocks.
.TP
\f[B]--sort-padding\f[R]
Move all PADDING blocks to the end of the metadata and merge them into a
single block.
